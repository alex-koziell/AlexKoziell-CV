          <p>
            I am developing a formal framework for hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms
            using a branch of pure mathematics called category theory.
          </p>
          <p>
            This helps with the design of programming languages for these hybrid algorithms,
            as well as bringing to bear techniques from both
            machine learning and quantum computing to improve these hybrid algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            A nice feature of category theory allows us to draw quantum machine learning algorithms as
            diagrams that, while still being mathematically rigorous, are incredibly intuitive!

              I am exploring the application of reinforcement learning and graph neural networks to optimize
              quantum circuits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Optimizing quantum circuits is crucial for advancing the efficiency and scalability of quantum computing,
              directly impacting its practical applications in fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, and materials science.
              I am working as part of a small team to try to leverage machine learning to improve the optimization process.
              This involves the use of graph neural networks, which capitalize on the graph-like structure inherent to circuits,
              as well as reinforcement learning, in which a machine learning agent learns through interacting with and exploring an
              environment.

        I've loved sport throughout my life, and am a avid skiier, windsurfer, and tennis player,
        among many others.
      </p>
      <p>
        From motivating me to look after my health, to stress relief, to allowing me to discover some
        of the best friends I've ever met, participating in sport has had a profound
        impact on my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my core values is to help bring this positive impact to others, no matter how small and
        in whatever way I can. Having twice been Men's Captain of Oxford University Gymnastics
        team, it has brought me a lot of joy to help people grow from complete beginners in the sport
        to competing in university tournaments at a national level.
